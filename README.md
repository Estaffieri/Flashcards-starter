## Developer

## Project Links
[Repo](https://github.com/Estaffieri/flashcards)

## Set-up
- Fork the repo and clone it down into your terminal.
- Open in text editor.
- Read the README.
- In the terminal, run command "open index.html" to interact with the app.

## Overview and Learning Goals
- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write Modular, reusable code that follows SRP.
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Progression
*8/17* - Create Kanban project board on git. Read project spec. and plan approach to workflow.

*8/18* - Add PR Template to file structure. Update Kanban board with tasks. Build out initial Card class structure.

*8/20* - Build out Turn class and tests. Refactor tests after peer project pairing. Implement a beforeEach to DRY up testing suites. Add files for Deck.js and Deck-test.js. Build and test Deck class. Finishing the Deck class, begin the Round class.

*8/22* - Completing this project with an extension. The round class has been completed with the addition of calculatePercentCorrect method and endRound method. Create the Game class. Add the game.start invocation to index.js

*8/23* - Tidying up required files for each class and running the game in the terminal. Fixed the endRoundMessage logging issue and the game works correctly with both correct and incorrect guesses.
