Created the Turn class with a better testing suite.

## Description
I created the turn class and connected it to the card class. I was able to make revisions to my tests later on in my work after pairing. The turn class has two properties and takes in an entire card object. I was initially overtesting my classes and so pared back a few extra lines that may not be needed at this level. I also updated the README with notes on today's progress.

## Motivation and Context
We needed a turn class to be able to take turns going over each flashcard. I wanted my tests to be efficient and effective.

## How Has This Been Tested?
This is a mocha and chai.expect testing environment. Each test was executed with "npm test" through the terminal until all were passing.
